# What is ICU?

- Stands for International Components for Unicode
- A set of libraries supporting localisation and internationalisation

ICU does a number of things:

1. Text handling and Unicode Support
	- Unicode is a standard encoding system for all the languages in the world. 倪好!
	- Allows software to process characters correctly regardless of language, ex. for applications that need to handle multilingual text.

2. String Comparison and Sorting
	- Different languages have rules for alphabetising text, and ICU provides functions that sort text according to regional language rules (collation) to make sure words are ordered correctly in each language.
